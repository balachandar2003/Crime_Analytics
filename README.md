# Crime Analytics
This project focuses on predicting crime rates in a country using various machine learning algorithms. 
## Project Overview
The project clusters crime data by gender, enabling a clearer understanding of crime distribution among males and females. It also predicts trends in children's offenses, particularly focusing on kidnapping incidents over the years.

# Outputs
## Clustering Results
### Gender-Based Crime Distribution: 
The project segments total crime statistics into male and female categories, offering insights into gender-specific crime trends.
## Periodic Predictions
### Children's Offenses:
Predictions regarding child offenses are generated, highlighting trends in kidnapping incidents over several years.
# Data Visualizations
## Static Graphs
### Yearly Crime Trends:
Static graphs display crime statistics over the years, categorized by crime type and state, allowing for easy comparison and analysis.
## Animated Graphs
### State-Wise Crime Rates:
An animated graph illustrates crime rates across different states over the years, with distinct colors representing each state. This dynamic visualization helps identify trends and patterns in crime rates throughout the country.
# Conclusion
This project leverages machine learning techniques and visualizations to provide insights into crime rates, facilitating better understanding and potential interventions. The combination of clustering, regression analysis, and dynamic visualizations makes it a comprehensive tool for crime rate prediction and analysis.
